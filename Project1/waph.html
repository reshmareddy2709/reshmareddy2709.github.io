            This course delves into crucial elements of web application development, encompassing front-end tools like HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS, alongside back-end technologies like PHP and MySQL. Participants will acquire practical skills in recognizing and mitigating potential security threats and vulnerabilities in web applications. The curriculum underscores the implementation of secure programming principles to minimize risks and fortify the robustness of web applications. So far, participants have successfully navigated through Lab-0, Lab-1, Lab-2, Hackathon-1, and Individual Project-1, gaining valuable hands-on experience in diverse aspects of web development and security.

        <!-- Lab-0 Overview -->
        <h2>Lab-0 Overview</h2>
        <p> 
        In the initial stage of Lab 0 within the Web Application Programming and Hacking course, I successfully laid the groundwork for my development environment. This encompassed configuring an Ubuntu 22.04 virtual machine through the UC Sandbox. To enhance the environment's efficiency, I installed essential software, including apache2, git, sublime text, pandoc, and the Chrome browser. Additionally, I established a private git repository on GitHub and shared it with Dr. Phu Phung, the instructor. Following this, I proceeded with cloning the local repository, editing the README.md file, and completing the Lab 0 exercises as instructed. Thorough documentation of the entire process was undertaken using Markdown, and I utilized the Pandoc tool to convert the document into a PDF format suitable for submission.

        <!-- Lab-1 Overview -->
        <h2>Lab-1 Overview</h2>
        <p>
         The lab was divided into two sections, with the initial focus on understanding the intricacies of the Web and HTTP Protocol, followed by hands-on practice in Basic Web Application Programming. In the first phase, I effectively utilized the Wireshark tool to capture and analyze the communication between my machine and a web server. I meticulously documented the entire process, encompassing details such as HTTP Request, Response messages, and the HTTP Stream, providing a comprehensive insight into the workings of the protocol. The latter part involved the development of CGI web applications in C and a straightforward PHP web application, demonstrating my proficiency in coding, compiling, and deploying programs on the web server. I successfully created a Hello World CGI program, another CGI program incorporating an HTML template, and PHP scripts. Additionally, I examined HTTP GET and POST requests using Wireshark and curl, showcasing a thorough understanding of these protocols

        <!-- Lab-2 Overview -->
        <h2>Lab-2 Overview</h2>
        <p>
       The lab consists of two assignments. In the initial part, I created a basic HTML page that incorporates JavaScript and forms. I developed a webpage called waph-yourusername.html, incorporating HTML elements such as an image, a form, and dynamic JavaScript features like displaying date/time and logging key presses. The second assignment involved the use of Ajax for user input, generating dynamic responses, applying CSS styling, utilizing jQuery for Ajax requests, and interacting with Web APIs to fetch programming jokes and estimate age based on user input. This lab provided hands-on experience in various aspects of web development, covering HTML, JavaScript, Ajax, CSS, jQuery, and API integration.
        </p>
       

        <!-- Hackathon-1 Overview -->
        <h2>Hackathon-1 Overview</h2>
        <p>
        The XSS Hackathon, focused on Cross-site Scripting, serves as an educational endeavor with the goal of exploring and understanding various levels of XSS vulnerabilities in web applications. XSS, a common security loophole, enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages, visible to other users. The hackathon involves two main objectives: Task 1 focuses on identifying and exploiting XSS vulnerabilities in a specified web application, while Task 2 revolves around implementing protective measures against XSS attacks to reduce the risk of exploitation.

        <!-- Individual Project-1 Overview -->
        <h2>Individual Project-1 Overview</h2>
        <p>
        The task involves creating a portfolio with the objective of highlighting my skills and capturing the interest of potential employers. The portfolio is currently available in a public repository. In addition to including information from my resume, I have completed extra assignments given by my professor, some of which were covered in previous lab exercises.
